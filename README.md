# Penalty Shootout Simulator - Java ⚽

A console-based mini-game simulating a football penalty shootout. The player chooses the direction of their shot, and the goalkeeper attempts to save it. After 5 shots, the final score is displayed.

## 🏆 Features
- **Shot Direction Selection**: Choose between Left, Center, or Right.
- **Random Goalkeeper Reaction**: The goalkeeper reacts randomly to each shot.
- **Final Score Display**: See the score at the end of the shootout.
- **Interactive Console Mode**: Simple and engaging command-line interface.

## 🚀 Installation and Execution

   ```bash

## 🛠️ How It Works
- The player is prompted to choose a direction (Left, Center, or Right) for each penalty shot.
- The goalkeeper randomly selects a direction to dive.
- If the player's shot direction matches the goalkeeper's dive, the shot is saved. Otherwise, it's a goal!
- After 5 shots, the final score is displayed.
